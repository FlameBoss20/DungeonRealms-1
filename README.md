# DungeonRealms
The 2016 Dungeon Realms code it currently uses + .ORG Beta code written by me (95%).
It even has Apollo's shitty soundtrack, so yes, it's fresh.

Now it's time to witness what kind of shit code you've been playing on for so long. 
Take a deep breath, take your time. Open the project, clone it. Look through the game code, let the lines of horrible code flow through you. Enjoy.

Just FYI From myself - If you are reading this, the link to my Github was posted somewhere. I'm not sure where, but I'd like to let you know that you can PM me via Skype or Discord anytime, I am FlameBoss20 on both of them. This code is 100% open source here, and I'd rather let someone who knows Java more to be working with it rather than myself. Love you all <3

I will create a setup tutorial
