# DungeonRealms
The 2016 Dungeon Realms code it currently uses + .ORG Beta code written by me (95%).
It even has Apollo's shitty soundtrack, so yes, it's fresh.

Now it's time to witness what kind of shit code you've been playing on for so long. 
Take a deep breath, take your time. Open the project, clone it. Look through the game code, let the lines of horrible code flow through you. Enjoy.

I've removed lots of code from the Beta package to prevent Mr.Keeling and his terrible developers from sniffing code from my systems.
I've rewritten Apollo's terrible networking, so, that's nice. c:

I also have removed the constants file. It had some stuff in it I prefer not to share.

I'm 100% sure there are some nutcrackers in the Dungeon Realms community which are able to run this code.

This is what you wanted lads. Go and figure out how to run it.

Again, Mr.Keeling, your ignorance doesn't help you. gl. hf.

pce lads.

(Thanks to matt11matthew & xFinityPro for contributing to the beta code.)
